Welcome to Mark6 VDAS's documentation!
======================================

The Mark6 VDAS project uses the reStructuredText (ReST) for documentation[1,2].
This markup has an number of advantages over plain text or traditional mark
up languages. In particular:

- It is easy to read in source format
- It can be easily compiled in to a number of different formats (e.g., html, pdf, 
  latex, etc.)

We also use the python Sphinx documentation system[2] to generate html and pdf forms
of this documentation.

To create an HTML version of the docs on a Unix machine:

* Install Sphinx (e.g., ``easy_install Sphinx``)

* In this directory, type ``make html``

The documentation will then be in  _build/html/index.html  and can be viewed
in a web browser.
