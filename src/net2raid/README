NET2RAID APPLICATION
====================

Overview
--------

This is the main recording application. It utilizes a RAID-0 based file system
to record data at 16 Gbps from 4 x 10 GE Myricom Ethernet cards. Four 8-disk
modules are required to sustain 16 Gbps recording. A significant amount of
work was done to optimize memory, processor, interrupt, and file system
settings to achieve this.

This capability was successfully demonstrated during the October 24th Westford
to GGAO two antenna, 16 Gbps experiment.

Files
-----

Makefile.am
  Build file.

main.cc
  Program entry point. Imports components from the src/common library directory.
  Provides command line option processing and co-ordinates the launching and
  termination of the multiple processes required for application execution.

  The main classes imported from src/common are NetReader and FileWriter.
  Most of the data plane code for this application are stored in those classes.
  A considerable amount of process optimization is achieved through the
  settings in the rc.mark6 configuration file in the root directory of the
  distribution.

netraid-run
  Program launch script. This is the script used to launch the net2raid
  application. Operators will typically call this from the command line
  to start a capture session. In the near future, the DRS(Data Recording
  Service) VSI-S control plane will be used instead.

test_main.cc
  CPPUNIT test harness for main function. Obsolete.
