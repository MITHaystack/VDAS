# Description:	This is a generic collection of disk-related functions that
#		are used for partitioning, creating file systems, optimizing
#		file system settings, creating RAID configurations, and
#		benchmarking disk performance.  The script requires two
#		input/configuration files:
#			disktools.rc	A set of colon delimited entries of
#					the form <device>:<mount point>.
#					For example...
#
#					/dev/sdb:/mnt/disk0
#					/dev/sdc:/mnt/disk1
#					/dev/sdd:/mnt/disk2
#			disktools.fio	An input file for the linux "fio" disk
#					benchmarking tool.
#					For example:
#
#					[disk8]
#					rw=write
#					iodepth=8
#					directory=/mnt/disk8
#					write_bw_log=disk8_write
#					fill_device=1


# Executables
MOUNT=/bin/mount
